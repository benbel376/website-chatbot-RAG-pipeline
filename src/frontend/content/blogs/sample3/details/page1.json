            "content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through building a production-ready RAG pipeline that efficiently processes documents, retrieves relevant context, and generates accurate responses.\n\nThis blog post covers the entire implementation process, from document processing to deployment, with a focus on scalability and performance. We'll explore key components like vector stores, embedding models, and prompt engineering, while addressing common challenges in RAG implementations."
