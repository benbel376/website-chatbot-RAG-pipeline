        "content": "In this project, we developed an end-to-end bidlist optimization algorithm for real-time bidding (RTB) on The Trade Desk (TTD) platform, covering essential stages like data preprocessing, KPI calculations, scoring, and budget-based optimization. Through mutual information-based feature selection, Bayesian smoothing, and constrained bid adjustments, the algorithm provides a robust framework for maximizing engagement and performance within financial constraints.\n\nBy building this bidlist optimization model, we not only enhance bid efficiency but also ensure that budget utilization is aligned with performance objectives. This approach is crucial for advertisers aiming to gain a competitive advantage in the dynamic RTB ecosystem.\n\nFor those looking to take the optimization further, machine learning models offer promising alternatives for scoring and bid adjustment. These models can dynamically adapt to changing market conditions, making them valuable for advertisers seeking real-time flexibility and enhanced precision. However, traditional techniques are powerful on their own, especially in scenarios where simplicity and efficiency are paramount.",
